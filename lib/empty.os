!  This file may help load programs optionally. For example, if B transforms to
!  the Boolean constant TRUE, then the LOAD clause
!
!    (load (if b then p else ''lib.empty''))
!
!  loads a file specified by the pathname P. If B transforms to FALSE, then the
!  LOAD clause effectively does nothing. It's also fun to GPL an empty file.
