This directory contains many small GNU C source files that help implement parts
of  the Orson library.  Most have  only INCLUDE  directives that  insert header
files  from the GNU  C library.   However, the  file WIDTHS.C  initializes some
large arrays, which canâ€™t be done efficiently by the current version of Orson.

    dirent.c      Include dirent.h.
    errno.c       Include errno.h.
    locale.c      Include locale.h.
    math.c        Include math.h.
    pwd.c         Include pwd.c.
    setjmp.c      Include setjmp.h.
    signal.c      Include signal.h.
    stat.c        Include sys/stat.h.
    stdio.c       Include stdio.h.
    stdlib.c      Include stdlib.h.
    string.c      Include string.h.
    time.c        Include sys/timeb.h and time.h.
    types.c       Include sys/types.h.
    unistd.c      Include unistd.h.
    wchar.c       Include wchar.h.
    widths.c      Tables of character widths.

The following files contain documentation and other supporting material.

    README        What you're reading now.
    Readme.by     Bracy source for Readme.html.
    Readme.html   Long HTML version of README.

These files are  available for free, under the terms of  the GNU General Public
License (GPL)  version 3, so  they may be  used by free Orson  programs. People
bothered by  this are invited  to make their  Orson programs free, or  to write
their own libraries. The file WIDTHS.C  has the usual GNU copyright notice, but
the other C sources do not, because it seems silly to put such notices in files
with only one or two lines.
