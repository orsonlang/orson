The Orson  compiler Orson is  written in  GNU C, and  is intended to  run under
Unix-like systems, such as GNU/Linux.  It needs only the GNU C Library, and may
work with other standard C libraries as well.  Actually Orson isn’t a compiler,
but a  translator. It converts  programs written in  Orson to equivalent  GNU C
programs,  then calls  the GNU  C  compiler GCC  to compile  them. These  files
contain GNU  C source  code for the  Orson compiler. The  allegedly interesting
ones are marked with ‘✗’.

    cast.c        Explicitly change the types of expressions.
    char.c        Operations on characters.

    debug.c       Functions for debugging.
    declare.c     Encrypt Orson declarations as C declarations.
    emit.c        Write commonly used pieces of C code.

Both the Orson compiler and the  C programs it produces require features of GNU
C that  might not  be present in  other dialects  of C. These  features include
arbitrary length  names, auto  arrays whose lengths  are computed at  run time,
hexadecimal floating point  constants, nested functions, statement expressions,
zero length arrays, and the ‘?:’ operator. This may not be a complete list.

The Orson  compiler is available for free,  under the terms of  the GNU General
Public License (GPL) version 3.
